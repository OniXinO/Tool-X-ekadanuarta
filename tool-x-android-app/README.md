# Tool-X Android App

This is a simple Android app wrapper for Tool-X. It provides an easier way to install and launch Tool-X on Android devices through Termux.

## Features

- Checks if Termux is installed, and if not, directs the user to F-Droid to install it
- Automates the Tool-X installation process in Termux
- Provides a simple button to launch Tool-X

## Building the App

1. Open this project in Android Studio
2. Build the APK or AAB file
3. Install it on your Android device

## Requirements

- Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher
- Termux app installed from F-Droid

## Note

This app is a convenience wrapper - it still requires Termux to function, as Tool-X runs in a Linux environment.
